\begin{abstract}
  Given a functional specification and an expression syntax, the
  Syntax-Guided Synthesis problem is to find an expression in the
  given syntax that satisfies the functional specification. 

  What is enumeration?
  Where does enumeration fail?
  While 

  In this paper, we describe a synthesis technique that is based on
  extending the reach of the enumeration technique by separately
  enumerating
  \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
  \item smaller expressions that are correct on subsets of inputs, and
  \item predicates on inputs that distinguish these subsets.
  \end{inparaenum}
  These smaller expressions and predicates are then combined by using
  decision trees to obtain an expression that is correct on all inputs.

  We implemented this technique in a prototype tool and evaluated it on
  the benchmarks from the SyGuS 2015 competition.
  Our tool is able to match the running times and the compactness of
  solutions of both standard enumerative solver as well as the latest
  white-box solvers in most cases.
  Further, our solver is able to solve a number of instances from
  a previously unsolved class of benchmarks.
