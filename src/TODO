Testing -- 
	Check binding in terms, should throw exceptions and die
	all semantics (especially bv)
	strings benchmarks
	test driver

Bug in point distinct enumerator:
	Which parts of the point should be used for the signature

Should be easy:
	Default grammars
		BV
		SLIA

Fix termsolver_lia and unifier_lia w.r.t to points and canonical synthfun invocations
LIA subgrammars?
LIA specific unifier -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA specific termsolver -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters

LIA multifunction single invocation : How much do we care?

Add constant +, - 

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow

All grammar features
	Variable, InputVariable, LocalVariable

_--- SYGUS 2015 errors

../benchmarks/SyGuS-COMP15/GENERAL-Track/seven_three_d1.sl has spurious variables

Separate multiple function synthesis if constraints are disjoint

Change single point invocation meaning
