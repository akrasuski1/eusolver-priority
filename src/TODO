let's
	Lets and if's interact very weirdly

BV theory - add all functions

Rewrite lets in constraints

Default grammars

All grammar features
	Other weird things?
	Constant, Variable, InputVariable

Grammar decomposer - sort of
	Bug in grammar decomposer - qm_* benchmarks exhibit bug
	Generally, problem expanding macro functions in grammars

LIA subgrammars?
LIA specific unifier -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA specific termsolver -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters

multi-function synthesis -- first version done
	LIA multi-function

Change single point invocation meaning
Test all semantics

Test strings

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow
