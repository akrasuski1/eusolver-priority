	Bug in grammar decomposer - qm_* benchmarks exhibit bug
	Generally, problem expanding macro functions in grammars

LIA specific unifier -- first version done
LIA specific termsolver

Grammar pruning

let's
multi-function synthesis

BV theory - add all functions

Default grammars

All grammar features
	Other weird things?

Test all semantics

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow
