let's
	Lets and if's interact very weirdly
	Careful while rewriting constraints
Rewrite lets in constraints

Fix termsolver_lia and unifier_lia w.r.t to points and canonical synthfun invocations

Default grammars

Change single point invocation meaning

All grammar features
	Other weird things?
	Constant, Variable, InputVariable

BV theory - add all functions

Grammar decomposer - sort of
	Bug in grammar decomposer - qm_* benchmarks exhibit bug
	Generally, problem expanding macro functions in grammars

LIA subgrammars?
LIA specific unifier -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA specific termsolver -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA multifunction single invcation

multi-function synthesis -- first version done
	LIA multi-function

Test all semantics

Test strings

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow
