Testing -- 
	strings benchmarks
	test driver

Important stuff
	Point distinct enumerator for multiple function multiple invocations?

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow

All grammar features
	Variable, InputVariable, LocalVariable

_--- SYGUS 2015 errors

../benchmarks/SyGuS-COMP15/GENERAL-Track/seven_three_d1.sl has spurious variables

Separate multiple function synthesis if constraints are disjoint

Change single point invocation meaning

Should be easy:
	Default grammars
		BV - Not many benchmarks of this sort
		SLIA - Is it even allowed?

Add constant +, - : Only one benchmark where its important
