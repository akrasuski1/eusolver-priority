Grammar decomposer - sort of
	Bug in grammar decomposer - qm_* benchmarks exhibit bug
	Generally, problem expanding macro functions in grammars

LIA subgrammars?
LIA specific unifier -- first version done
LIA specific termsolver -- first version done

multi-function synthesis -- first version done
	LIA multi-function

Multiple invocations
	Shouldn't be too hard

Change single point invocation meaning

let's

BV theory - add all functions

Rewrite lets in constraints

Default grammars

All grammar features
	Other weird things?
	Constant, Variable, InputVariable

Test all semantics

Test strings

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow
