All grammar features
	Constant, Variable, InputVariable, LocalVariable

Check binding in terms

Default grammars

Change single point invocation meaning

BV theory - add all functions

Grammar decomposer - sort of
	Bug in grammar decomposer - qm_* benchmarks exhibit bug
	Generally, problem expanding macro functions in grammars

Fix termsolver_lia and unifier_lia w.r.t to points and canonical synthfun invocations
LIA subgrammars?
LIA specific unifier -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA specific termsolver -- first version done
	Fix weird bugs with formal parameters
LIA multifunction single invcation

Test all semantics

Test strings

--- Probably not for competition

Grammar pruning - done for commutativity, probably not associativity till after competition

CAV 15 strategy
	Grammar unroller

LIA optimizations
	pairwise unification
	Linear classifier unification
	Geometric unification? Some evidence that it is slow
